## Description

This application demostrates a UART transaction between two serial ports on the MAX78000. 1024 bytes are transmitted between the two serial ports and the receive and transmit buffers are compared to verify a successful transmission transpired.

## Setup

##### Building Firmware:
Before building firmware you must select the correct value for _BOARD_  in "Makefile", either "EvKit\_V1" or "FTHR\_RevA", depending on the EV kit you are using to run the example.

After doing so, navigate to the directory where the example is located using a terminal window. Enter the following comand to build all of the files needed to run the example.

```
$ make
```

##### Required Connections:

If using the Standard EV Kit (EvKit_V1):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Connect pins 1 and 2 (P0.1) of the JH1 (UART 0 EN) header.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
-   Connect JH2.2 (P0.12) to JH4.2 (P1.1).
-   Connect JH2.4 (P0.13) to JH4.4 (P1.0).

If using the Featherboard (FTHR_RevA):
-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN1 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open a terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.
- 	Connect J8.7 (P1.1) to J8.14 (P2.6)
-	Connect J8.8 (P1.0) to J8.15 (P2.7)

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
**************** UART Example ******************
This example sends data from one UART to another.

Connect the TX pin of UART3 to the RX pin of UART2 for this example.

-->UART Baud    : 115200 Hz

-->Test Length  : 1024 bytes

-->UART Initialized

-->Data verified

-->EXAMPLE SUCCEEDED
