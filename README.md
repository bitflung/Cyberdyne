# Cyberdyne
 
Firmware dev getting started
- Checkout the repo
- Launch eclipse; I suggest that you start with a fresh workspace but it shouldn't be neccesary
- Click: File -> open Projects from Filesystem
- Top right, click Directory and navigate to the checked out repo: Cyberdyne/Eclipse/Cyberdyne_proj
- Click Select Folder to pick Cyberdyne_proj
- Eclipse will oad the project by default
- Click the big hammer icon at top left to build the project
- Expectations: build success


Firmware Status
- Initial check-in builds a binary using only the code Saurabh shared
- ADUP source exists in the project and is built, but not yet linked because I haven't integrated it yet
